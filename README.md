# Obsidian Gym Log
A simple gym workout log for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

To use this you need to edit your own exercises and workouts.
There is a basic example workout with two exercises included.

The example files still have Swedish text in them. That will be fixed eventually.

There are three different views/pages:
- Overview / a list of workouts that have been performed. This includes a heatmap.
- A workout view. Includes a list of exercies to perform showing the last weight used and what effort was needed.
- An exercise view that shows instructions and the last few times this exercise was performed.
- At the bottom is a graph of the logged effort and weights used when performing this exercise.
